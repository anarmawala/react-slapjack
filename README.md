# Slapjack by Arshad | Jigar | Angela | Clark

Slapjack, a card game that puts every player’s reaction to the test. The object of the game is to win all the cards of the deck that are played at the center by all players. A player can win all the cards put in the center by slapping the center when a jack is put down. In the case of a desktop game, they’d be pressing a button. Each hand is facedown so that players are unable to see their own cards. Otherwise, a player would be aware when they’re about to put down a card.
