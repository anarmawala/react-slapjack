Game Ideas
 - slapjack (very simple, need to track who makes fastest moves and notify server)
 - scrabble (lots of moving parts)
 - go fish (lots of server communication b/w players)
 - pay or play (pretty simple, full deck needs to be faceup for users)
 
 Unlikely
  - jeopardy (too simple)
   - UNO (too many ppl doing same thing)
